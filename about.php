                        <p>KSPowerlifting was originally an idea for purely just an online powerlifting hub; a center of information. After further thought and insight into the sport of powerlifting, we realized there isn’t an all in one website that provides everything a power lifter would need, whether beginner or advanced. With KSP we plan to hit every corner of the sport</p>
                        <p>Our website will be a hub of information where lifters and sport fanatics can research different federation, lifter rankings, and meet information, amongst other things! Also, we will be providing many useful features so the lifter will never need to use another source for calculations.</p>
                        <p>Along with the website we will be starting up a YouTube channel to encourage beginners to lift and lift heavy and responsibly. On our channel will be how-to’s on basic lifts, suggestions on other accessory work, instructional videos on how to properly warm up, and much more! We’ll also probably post some ridiculous vlogs to maintain the entertainment aspect.</p>
                        <p>Our latest addition to KSP is our clothing line, Omega. Being an omega male/female means you have no restrictions to abide by, no one to tell you what to do, and nobody to tell you what you can’t do. Omegas don’t need anyone but themselves. Be an Omega. Check out our clothing line!</p>
                        <p>In addition to our clothing line we will eventually be reselling powerlifting equipment. This is going to be our next step in the process of building this company and that will be an option available in the near future! We would appreciate if you guys left suggestions on what brands you’d prefer we resell to the public.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, our end goal is to open up a powerlifting gym in the NYC area. There aren’t many currently open that can accommodate the influx of new power lifters in the widely populated area. Many fitness centers across the city are attempting to accommodate them by placing deadlift platforms in cramped areas of the gym but many situations are not ideal. We want to revolutionize powerlifting gyms in NYC and we look forward to being the best in the area.</p>
